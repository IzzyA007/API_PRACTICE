#JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the language of APIs. It encodes data structures for easy machine readability.
# APIs primarily pass data back and forth in JSON format.

#However, if we are specifically interested in countries within a certain region, such as Sub-Saharan Africa,
#we need to utilize query parameters to refine our request. Keep in mind that APIs accept different query parameters,
#which is why consulting the API's documentation is essential.
